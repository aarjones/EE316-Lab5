Pins:
	POT on ADC0
	LDR on ADC1

	Servo PWM on IO4
	Motor/LEDs PWM Timer on IO5
	Buzzer PWM on IO6

	LCD on IO 3..0

	RGB LEDs

	PMOD JA bottom row Buttons
	
Blocks:
	Interrupts
		Concat
	gpio lcd
	modify gpio for buttons
	modify pwm blocks
	
Processor Frequency: 
	PWM Component runs at 50 MHz
		Period: 1000000 = 20 ms
	
We're able to:
	Read XADC voltage (0-1.650)
	Set Servo PWM from 2.5-12.5%
	Set Buzzer PWM period 
	
We need to add:
	Set motor/LED pwm (same code)
	Interrupts for buttons
	Interrupts for running code currently in while(1)
	Display modes on LCD
